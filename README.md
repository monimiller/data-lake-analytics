### Welcome
Welcome to the Data Lake Analytics Reporting Structures tutorial with Starburst
Galaxy on AWS. The intent of the tutorial was to demonstrate a feasible example
of data lake reporting structures. With AWS S3 as the data lake and Starburst
Galaxy serving as the analytics engine, I hope you were able to experience
firsthand the benefits of implementing comprehensive data lake analytics
solutions.

I chose to use a public dataset because transparency is extremely important to
me, and I wanted the lab to be reproducible by anyone at any time, without any
barriers. I consider myself at least partially a kinesthetic learner, and I
personally have only been able to buy into the value of something once I could
explore it and then adopt it on my own. Since we are utilizing the [AWS Covid 19
Data Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/covid-19-data-lake/), all you need to try this tutorial out for yourself is a set of AWS
credentials (you can create a free account as well) and a free Starburst Galaxy
free trial.

To learn more about these concepts, visit our blog post which dives deeper into
the reason behind this tutorial.
